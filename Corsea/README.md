Completed coursework in deep neural networks, sequence modeling (Transformers, RNNs/LSTMs/GRUs), and CNNs. This folder contains selected personal implementations and notes (e.g., date translation with attention, trigger-word detection, and LSTM music generation). Materials are for personal study only; some assets may be subject to Coursera copyrightâ€”please contact me for takedown.
